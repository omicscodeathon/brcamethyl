Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Download whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) reads from SRA explorer
. Perform quality control of sequence reads using FASTQC and MULTIQC
. Trimming of adapter sequences and filtering of low quality reads from paired-end reads using Trimgalore
. Indexing of human reference genome (hg38) using Bismark genome preparation tool and Bowtie2 pre genome alignment
. Aligment/Mapping of WGBS dataset to the indexed hg38 genome using Bismark alignment tool
. Deduplication after alignment to rid reads with multiple mapping positions using Bismark deduplication tool 
. Use the Bismark Methylation extraction tool to call all methylated cytosines in the alignment file 
. Generate summary report
. Use the Integrative Genome Software to view the methylation levels using the bedGraph file
. Perform Differential Methylation Analysis using DMRcate software
