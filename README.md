## Background
Breast cancer ranks as the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, comprising 12% of the global cancer burden (Sedeta et al., 2023). Its pathogenesis involves intricate interplay between genetic and epigenetic alterations, with mounting evidence underscoring the pivotal role of DNA methylation in disease onset (Kanwal & Gupta, 2012; Thakur et al., 2022). 
**DNA methylation** involves adding a methyl group to the DNA and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, maintaining genomic stability, and controlling cell differentiation (Moore et al., 2012). Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes, are characteristic features of cancer. These epigenetic alterations can result in gene silencing or activation, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis (Geissler et al., 2024). Elucidating these methylation changes offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer and can aid in identifying potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targets (De Almeida et al., 2019).
